Changes
=======

In next release ...

- Patch the translation domain instead of the (higher-level)
  global translation function.

  This fixes an issue where messages would not be recorded with the
  proper translation domain and the used target languages would not be
  correctly registered.

1.0 (2011-11-28)
----------------

- Initial public release.
